# Power-Booster-App
Power Booster App is our project that led our victory in the hackathon. We solved an environmental problem using Java, in which we  focused on generating maximum clean renewable energy to minimize carbon emission and need for fossil fuel.
## How Does it work?
It works by taking lattitude of your place, day of the month and hour of the day to calculate Azimuth Angle (Angle of the sun to the surfaace) and Tilt Angle (angle of solar panel from horizontal surface) to suggest the best angle to ensure maximum energy producton. It uses Java Socket to push angle to the client remotely.
